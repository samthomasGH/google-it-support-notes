# Google IT Support Certificate Notes & Labs

This repository is my learning journal while completing the **Google IT Support Professional Certificate**.  
It contains:
- Study notes
- Troubleshooting checklists
- Scripts (Windows PowerShell, Linux bash)
- Lab write-ups

I am using GitHub to practice documentation and version control â€” key skills for IT Support and SysAdmin roles.
